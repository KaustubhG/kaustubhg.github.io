 Hello! :)
</p>

<p>
 My name is Kaustubh Gondhalekar. I am a grad student at NC State, pursuring my Masters in Computer Science. Currently I am tinkering with XINU Kernel (an academic UNIX like kernel) as a part of my Operating Systems course. Its pretty awesome!
 I also am learning about balanced trees in Advanced Data Structures (pretty kick-ass stuff)!
</p>

I love to read physical books than their e-versions. The touch and feel of a page (plus the fragrance of a new book!) and the satisfaction of actually turning the page while reading enhances the pleasure of reading. Although since the practicality of e-books far outweights that of a physical book, slowly and reluctantly I am making the transition. I seldom listen to songs while I am studying or working on something. I prefer to exclusively listen to music, rather than as background activity. I love running; it feels kind of meditative. I frequently go on evening runs.
I am also a fan of to-do lists, and chalking stuff out on paper; basically doodling :)

I have started dabbling into meditation recently. Currenlty I don't know for sure whether I am going in a trance or just dozing off during my meditation sessions :p. But I guess I'll stick to it and find out what comes out of it :)

Well, that pretty much sums it up I think!

> PS: (I currently live in Raleigh, NC)
Raleigh is a beautiful city. There's ample greenary here (lots of oak trees) and a beautiful lake nearby where I sometimes go with friends. The weather here at Raleigh is delightful! The winter is enjoyable, unlike the frigid cold and winds in the mid-west and up north. In a nut-shell its a nice place! :)
