I frequently listen to songs. I won’t consider my self a classical music aficionado (although I sure do tap into it from time to time) but I sure do listen lots of hindi playback music and some english songs. I am writing this article specifically to describe the beauty of the plethora of variations of famous songs that exist on the internet. 

Whenever I like a song, I sure do listen it on loop for its fair share. But then, I check out the covers, unplugged/acoustic versions of the songs on youtube. And I feel that many of these are even a notch better than the original song. The original movie-songs feel a bit artificial. The covers by local artists feel a lot more (I don’t know the exact word for this feeling by I’ll go with) homely and pleasing to listen. Plus you really get to appreciate the slight nuances that are induced when another artists sing the same song. I guess thats what people like about listening to music. Putting on a playlist of new music doesn’t really strike the right cord. But a playlist of your favorite songs…, I think its the familiarity and the variations that are actually firing up the right neurons that make you feel really good!

Well, thats about it. Lots of great artists out there. Do listen to different versions of your favorite songs. You’ll probably like them even more! :)
